Introduction
-------------
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at anytime.

Cyclisticcis a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. 

Business Problem 
------------
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, they believe that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.

Business Task
------------
Analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify the behavior of the casual rider and annual member to enhance the number of annual members through marketing strategies to increase profit.
